Each data point represents the sale of an item in a shop on a particular date. There are two million nine hundred thirty-five thousand eight hundred forty-nine observations in 6 features.\n","\n","There are 21,807 items sold in 60 shops. The items are divided into 84 item categories.\n","\n","The sale in different shops is certainly not uniform. Some shops sell better than others (Shops with ids from 20 to 35 do very well. The shop_ids less than 20 does worse than shop_ids more than 35).\n","\n","Looking at the sales per date-block, we can see that the sales have decreased over the years from 2013 to 2015 with a couple of spikes in between. The year 2013 begins with 200K+ items sold and at the end of 2015 we see it almost halved with 100K+ items sold.\n","\n","The requirement is to predict monthly sales of each item in each shop. \n","\n","\n","During the first level assessment, we have identified a few quality issues which need to be rectified. Along with this, we also have some transformation ideas as well that will derive more information from the dataset.\n","\n","Training Set\n","\n","Quality Issues\n","\n","1. Round all float values in the dataframe to two decimal places\n","2. Remove the row with item_id = 0 \n","3. Remove 6 duplicate rows\n","4. There is a row with index 484683 where the item_price is negative\n","5. Downcast dataframe to save memory\n","6. Remove rows where items have been returned (7356 rows). These are rows with negative values\n","7. Remove rows where item_cnt_day > 100. There are about 138 rows\n","\n","Tidiness Issues\n","\n","1. Combine sales_train and item_categories with item_id\n","\n","Add New Features\n","\n","1. Item_price_class - Divide item prices into 4 classes\n","2.
